				NightCity is a single player 3-D browser based game that provides an immersive experience by allowing the user to interact with the game using their hands as if they were using an actualy steering wheel to drive around NightCity. Inspired by the following music video, the goal of the game is to get up to 20 points by dodging the demon to win. The player loses if they lose 3 consecutive points in a row.
